# TestPackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of TestPackage is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of TestPackage from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("TestPackage")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CC89/RAdvanced")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(TestPackage)
## basic example code
myFun(5)
myFun(5,5)
```


## Data

This package also includes transaction data. 

```{r data}
data("transactions")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r summary}
summary(transactions)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
plot(transactions$PurchAmount)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
